# INTVAL 3

What is this?

The INTVAL3 is an open source intervalometer for the Bolex 16mm camera. The goal of the project is to create a cheap-to-make intervalometer that can be used to automate timelapse or animation capture using mobile, web or physical controls.

This is the third incarnation of the INTVAL project, this time utilizing the Raspberry Pi Zero W for Wifi and Bluetooth control. Earlier versions, the INTVAL and INTVAL2 were Arduino-based.
